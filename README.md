PHP Algorithms

==========

A collection of common algorithms for practice or review

## Getting Started

The best way to use these examples is to read through the tests to understand what's expected of each solution. Then read through the solution until you understand it. Better yet, comment out or remove the solution and try to get the tests passing yourself.

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `composer install` to install the dependencies. If you don't have Composer yet, you can get it [here](https://getcomposer.org).
3. Run `bin/phpspec run` to run the tests.
4. All tests are in the `spec` directory and solutions are located in `src`.
5. Once you understand whats going on, remove the solution code and try to get it working again on your own.
6. Go forth and conquer!

## Purpose

Being a self-taught developer, I built these problems for myself to learn and practice. I've posted them so others can benefit from the same practice. Also, if I've gotten anything wrong, I'm sure someone will let me know and then I'll get to learn again!

You can use these to prepare for interviews, bootcamp prep or just for fun.

**Just remember**:

1. Read through the example.
2. Understand what each line of code is doing.
3. Try it yourself and get the tests passing.
4. Repeat!
